Return codes:
0 = success
1 = error during its lexical analysis (e.g. bad structure of the current lexeme).
2 = error during its syntactic analysis (e.g. bad program syntax).
3 = error during the semantic analysis and checks of the type incompatibility.
4 = error during the rest of semantic checks (e.g. missing definition, multiple definition, etc.).
5 = error during the target code generation (e.g. not enough statically allocated memory).
9 = internal compiler error such as errors not influenced by the input program (e.g. not enough memory for the translation structures, failure to open input/output files, etc.).

+ two classes have the same name
+ two global functions have the same name (overloading)
+ two class fields have the same name
+ local variable has the same name as some class, some global function, some variable in the same block.

It is not allowed to define a [instance] variable of the same name as some defined method in the same class.

It is not possible to define a [local] variable of the same name as some defined function/class or variable defined in the same block.

Multiple definitions of variable with the same name in the same scope are forbidden.

- string literals

Every function has to be defined exactly once.

Every program in VYPlanguage has to contain exactly one main function named main with the type signature void main \( void \), otherwise a semantic error occurs

A method of the same name as the class returning void and without parameters is called constructor. There is one embedded class called Object as the root of the inheritance hierarchy.

It is not allowed to define a variable of the same name as some defined method in the same class.

It is not possible to define a local variable of the same name as some defined function/class or variable defined in the same block.
